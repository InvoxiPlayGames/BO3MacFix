## What does it do? (Nerd stuff)

There are two big issues with Steam Workshop map loading in the current (v98, from 2019) Mac build of BO3:

* Texture (.png) conversion crashes the game when hovering or selecting a workshop map
* Havok navmesh/navvolume files are a different format across PC and Mac

This project hooks into the game to solve both these problems. It solves the texture problem by stubbing out
the faulty function, and solves the navmesh problem by converting it on-the-fly using a modded version of the
modding SDK. We call Wine from within the native Mac game process to call upon the modding SDK, after saving
a snapshot of the Havok navmesh/navvolume data from the map, and the patch to the SDK's cod2map tool takes
that input and outputs in the Mac-encoded format.

A macOS update also updated the version of libcurl that was included with the OS, which makes online login
fail in Black Ops 3 due to improper usage of the cURL library that's technically "undefined behaviour". This
is fixed here by removing one of the HTTP headers the game manually sets and letting cURL do its thing.
Version numbers are spoofed when signing in to match the Windows version's to enable matchmaking between the
two.
